# ECG-Arrhythmia-Detection
# 🫀 ECG Arrhythmia Detection Using Deep Learning (Synthetic Data)

This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify ECG signals into multiple classes, including **Normal**, **Arrhythmia**, and abnormalities such as **ST Depression**, **ST Elevation**, and **T Wave Inversion** — using **synthetically generated ECG signals**.

## 💡 Motivation

Heart arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats that can lead to serious health risks such as strokes or sudden cardiac arrest. Timely and accurate detection is crucial. This project aims to create a cost-effective, automated system using machine learning to classify ECG signals for real-time screening and monitoring.
